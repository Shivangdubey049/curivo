                        <h3>Sakshi Singh Dhoni Rawat</h3>
                        <p class="role"></p>
                        <p>Sakshi Rawat was born in Dehradun, India, and they first met in school. However, they only reconnected much later when MS Dhoni was already an established cricketer. The two shared a friendship during their school days, but their romantic relationship blossomed when they met again in Kolkata while Dhoni was touring with the Indian cricket team. Sakshi has been a constant pillar of support for Dhoni, particularly during the high-pressure years of his career. While Dhoni's on-field persona is calm and composed, it’s clear that off the field, Sakshi provides him with emotional grounding and a sense of normalcy.</p>
